    <p>Tofu was born at the end of March 2024 so it has been 4 months since then. When she came to our house, she was so tiny. She mainly <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://brotperson.nl/2024/07/10/100724/">slept on blåhajs</a> at night but sometimes took a nap on my slippers (fluffy house shoes). One of our shoe racks is located near a big window and it is a bit warm there because of the sunshine. Naturally she stayed there during the day.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/300724/20240514_095942348.jpg"></p>
<p>She was even smaller than my shoe size (37, EU size) back then! My friend on fediverse suggested comparing her right now with the slippers so I tried to recreate the previous photo. But she was already too big and did not fit in the space. That’s why she no longer takes a nap there. See, she is already bigger than my slippers.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/300724/20240722_073542168.jpg"><br><img src="/uploads/300724/20240721_064715907.jpg"></p>
<p>Similarly, she no longer sleeps on blåhajs because she is too big for that place. Again I tried to recreate the photo with blahåjs to show how big she became.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/300724/20240515_170710097.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="/uploads/300724/20240722_1031038861.jpg"></p>
<p>She didn’t want to sit on blåhajs so I put her favourite candies on them. I took a picture while she was eating them so her face is funny (as if she did something naughty). Her favourite nap place right now is on the bed in our guest room, where she can enjoy the sunshine. Grow well and stay comfy, tofu!</p>
